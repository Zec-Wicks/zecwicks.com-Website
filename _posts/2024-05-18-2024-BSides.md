I recently had the pleasure of attending BSides Adelaide, the first-ever Adelaide edition of this dynamic InfoSec event. It was a vibrant mix of workshops, challenges, and talks that brought together enthusiasts, professionals, and innovators from across the cybersecurity spectrum. I’m thrilled to share some highlights from this fantastic experience and reflect on how it’s shaping my journey in security.

# A Dive into the Challenges
One of the most exciting parts of BSides was getting my hands dirty with both the CTF (Capture the Flag) and Blackbag challenges. The CTF tested my technical skills, pushing me to explore creative problem-solving under a time crunch. The Blackbag challenge was a thrilling scavenger hunt that combined elements of espionage with digital forensics, requiring both persistence and keen observation. These hands-on activities were not just entertaining—they were incredibly rewarding learning experiences, enhancing my practical understanding of cyber techniques.

# Hacking My Badge – Because Why Not?
What's a BSides event without a little badge hacking? Tinkering with my attendee badge gave me an opportunity to dive into some BASIC coding, a first for me. There’s something uniquely satisfying about customizing a device meant to be worn around your neck, transforming it into a part of the hacking experience. It’s one of those quirks that make BSides events truly special.

# Learning from the Experts
Alongside the challenges, I had the chance to listen to incredible keynote speakers and explore various "villages" dedicated to different aspects of cybersecurity. Each talk was an insightful dive into the current and future landscape of information security, with perspectives ranging from defensive tactics to offensive strategies. Hearing firsthand from experts reinforced the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in this field.

# Looking Forward
BSides Adelaide 2024 has left me excited and inspired, with a toolkit full of new skills and insights. I can’t wait to apply these experiences to future challenges and see where the journey takes me. Here’s to next year’s event!
