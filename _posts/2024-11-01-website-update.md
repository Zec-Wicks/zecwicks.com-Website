For a while now I have been keen on learning web development, but did not want to resort to a php based website - what I learned at uni. I initially built my site using Vue. Vue was powerful and dynamic—honestly, it was overkill for what I needed. My site didn’t need extensive interactivity, and I found myself bogged down by unnecessary features.

After deploying the site on Cloudflare Pages with client-side rendering, I discovered another challenge: CSS. It felt like I was wrestling with styling conflicts more than actually enjoying the creative process. That’s when I realized I needed a new approach.

# Discovering Jekyll
Enter Jekyll, the static site generator that’s proven to be exactly what I was looking for. Jekyll strips things down to the essentials, focusing on simplicity and speed without sacrificing functionality. If you’re curious, the source code for my website is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Zec-Wicks/zecwicks.com-Website). Here’s why Jekyll has won me over:
- Streamlined Content Creation: Jekyll lets me write content in Markdown, converting it into static HTML. This has allowed me to concentrate on writing and organizing my site without worrying about backend complications.
- Speed and Performance: With static pages, my site loads much faster than a dynamic site would. This not only improves the user experience but also helps with search engine optimization.
- Enhanced Security: Without any server-side processing, static sites are inherently more secure. By eliminating the backend, I’ve reduced vulnerabilities like SQL injections and cross-site scripting, which gives me greater peace of mind.

# Embracing a CSS-Free Life (Mostly)
I’ll admit it: I’m not a designer. CSS quickly became the bane of my existence while working on my Vue site. Hours of tweaking only led to frustration, as small style changes often spiraled into endless conflicts. But with Jekyll, I’ve managed to sidestep this headache. Instead of obsessing over every styling detail, I can now focus on what I enjoy—creating content and refining functionality. The result may not be award-winning design, but it’s clean, functional, and much more enjoyable to maintain.

# Takeaway
Switching to Jekyll has been a breath of fresh air. My workflow is simpler, my site performs better, and I’ve freed myself from the constant struggles with CSS. Jekyll has allowed me to embrace a minimalist approach that prioritizes content and speed, and I couldn’t be happier with the outcome.
