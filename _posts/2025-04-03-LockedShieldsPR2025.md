Earlier this year, I had the privilege of participating in the NATO CCDCOE Locked Shields Partner Run 2025, one of the world’s largest and most complex live-fire cyber defence exercises.

I joined as co-lead of the Networks Team, alongside Nicole, and many other colleagues from DSTG. Our Networks Team of seven covered a wide landscape of technologies: firewalls (OPNSense, UFW, Fortinet), 5G networks, and satellite communications — defending the fictional nation of Berylia against the skilled red team attackers of Crimsonia.

We were part of an incredible Adelaide-based Blue Team of over 100 members, drawn from a wide cross-section of Australia’s cyber talent — including colleagues from DSTG, many University of Adelaide Students and industry partners.

Despite a strong defence and preventing several attacks, the threat actors eventually managed to breach our systems (as expected — they are very good!). But more than winning or losing, the key outcome for me was learning:
- I developed new technical skills across multiple network technologies
- I gained valuable experience in leading a team within a fast-paced, large-scale exercise
- I learned how to coordinate across multiple teams to support a complex national cyber defence mission

It was also my first time participating in Locked Shields — and I’m definitely looking forward to being involved again in the future.

A big thank you to Nicole and the rest of the Networks Team and the wider Adelaide team who supported this effort.
