Last week was an exciting milestone in my journey at Flinders University. As the newly elected President of the Flinders University Computer Society and the official GitHub Campus Expert for our university (and the only one in South Australia!), I ran my first educational workshop. With over 60 students in attendance, we delved into the basics of Git and GitHub, exploring how these essential tools can elevate collaboration and project management for everyone in tech.

# Why Git and GitHub?
For anyone looking to grow their coding skills and work collaboratively, understanding Git and GitHub is crucial. During the workshop, we focused on the basics: version control, branching, pull requests, and the all-important first steps of setting up and managing repositories. GitHub is a fantastic platform that goes beyond code storage—it’s a powerful tool for showcasing projects, collaborating with others, and contributing to open source. I wanted each student to leave with a solid foundation, feeling confident to start using GitHub in their own projects.

# Highlights of the Workshop
The turnout was fantastic, with over 60 eager participants joining us to explore GitHub’s potential. Together, we tackled common beginner challenges, and I answered a steady stream of questions about best practices and real-world applications. Watching students experience “aha” moments as they got hands-on with Git commands and pull requests was incredibly rewarding.

# Building the Future at Flinders
As President of the Computer Society and a GitHub Campus Expert, my goal is to make tech knowledge accessible, practical, and enjoyable. This workshop was just the beginning. I’m committed to organizing more events that combine education with hands-on experience and to fostering a community where students feel empowered to take the lead on their own projects.
