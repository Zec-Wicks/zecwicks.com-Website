My second year at DSTEM has been an enriching journey—one that pushed my boundaries both professionally and personally. Hosted at the vibrant UniSA City West Campus, DSTEM 2025 offered an engaging mix of learning, networking, and hands-on experiences that reaffirmed my commitment to a career in STEM.

# Stepping Up to the Challenge

One of the highlights of this year was presenting my work titled *Cyber Preparedness – a data science perspective*. In this presentation, I delved into the psychological aspects of cybersecurity, an area where data science meets human behavior. Despite a minor technical hiccup with the slides, the experience reinforced my belief in the power of perseverance. When unexpected challenges arise, it’s our ability to adapt and stay focused that truly defines us.

# Learning Beyond the Presentation

Beyond my presentation, DSTEM 2025 was packed with sessions that offered deep insights into relationship management, networking, wellbeing, mindfulness, and scientific communication. Each session was an opportunity not only to learn but also to reflect on how these skills are essential for personal and professional growth. The practical tips and shared experiences from industry peers have already started influencing how I approach challenges in my role as a Defence STEM Cadet.

# Reconnecting and Building Networks

One of the most rewarding aspects of DSTEM 2025 was the chance to reconnect with fellow cadets and professionals from entry-level programs across Australia. The networking opportunities were plentiful, allowing me to forge new connections and rekindle old ones. These relationships are not just valuable contacts—they’re a community of like-minded individuals passionate about innovation and a shared future in defence and STEM.

# Moving Forward

As I continue my journey in the Defence STEM Cadetship Entry Level Program, I’m excited to carry forward the lessons learned at DSTEM 2025. This experience has bolstered my resolve to tackle challenges head-on and to keep evolving as a communicator, a networker, and a scientist. I’m grateful for the opportunity to be part of an event that celebrates growth, resilience, and the spirit of innovation.

Thank you to everyone who made DSTEM 2025 a memorable experience. I can’t wait to see what next year brings!
