I recently had an amazing experience at the ACDC (Accelerating Cyber Defensive Capabilities) event, held at Edith Cowan University. This Red Team/Blue Team exercise provided a unique, high-stakes environment to test and expand my cyber defense skills, as I took on the role of a Blue Team member tasked with defending a virtual shipping port. Alongside my team from work, I faced real-time attacks from skilled Red Team members, who were relentless in their attempts to infiltrate and disrupt operations.

# Life in the Blue Team Trenches
Being part of the Blue Team was an immersive dive into the world of Security Operations Centers (SOC). The event’s realistic scenario—safeguarding the critical infrastructure of a shipping port—placed us in a high-pressure role, constantly alert for threats. The hands-on nature of the exercise exposed me to the intense paranoia, stress, and strategic thinking that come with defending against cyber threats. It was a firsthand lesson in the real demands of a SOC role, highlighting the need for vigilance, quick decision-making, and teamwork under pressure.


# The Power of Teamwork
One of the best aspects of the event was working closely with my colleagues. Being able to tackle challenges as a unit and rely on each other’s strengths brought a sense of camaraderie and resilience to our efforts. We leaned on each other for support, shared quick tips and strategies in real-time, and built a strong team dynamic that made even the toughest situations more manageable. While the redteam may have been able to infiltrate some of our defenses (and many of the poorly secured user accounts) with help from the white team, our teamwork and communication helped us quickly identify and mitigate the threats.


# Lessons in Offensive Cyber and Strategic Defense
The post-exercise debrief was an eye-opener, shedding light on the strategies and tactics of the Red Team. Observing how they approached vulnerabilities and bypassed defenses gave me valuable insights into offensive cybersecurity. This experience not only deepened my understanding of the adversarial mindset but also sparked my interest in expanding my skills into Red Team techniques—knowledge that will undoubtedly strengthen my abilities as a defender.

# Moving Forward with New Skills
The ACDC event was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills in a practical, team-based environment. Each aspect of the exercise, from the fast-paced attacks to the in-depth debrief, reinforced the importance of adaptability and resilience in cybersecurity. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn from such an experienced team and look forward to putting these skills to work.

Thank you to the organizers and participants for making this event a memorable and valuable experience. I can’t wait to see where my cybersecurity journey takes me next!
