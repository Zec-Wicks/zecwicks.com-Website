        <p>Hello! My name is Zechariah Wicks, and I am a third-year student at Flinders University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Software (Honours) alongside a Bachelor of Information Technology in Network and Cybersecurity Systems. I am dedicated to achieving academic excellence while continuously exploring the vast fields of software engineering and cybersecurity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From a young age, I have been captivated by technology's transformative power. My educational journey began at Westminster School, where I developed a strong foundation and passion. This early exposure to the possibilites of this field fueled my passion for technology and motivated me to dive deeper into computer science and related disciplines.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to my studies, I have gained diverse professional experience through various roles. At Westminster School, I work as a Casual Front of House Liaison, Theatre Technician, Tutor, and Boys Boarding Supervisor. These roles have honed my communication and leadership skills, allowing me to thrive in dynamic environments. As a Student and STEM Ambassador at Flinders University, I actively engage with peers and promote STEM fields, fostering a collaborative and innovative community. Most recently I have been priviledged enough to achieve the role of a STEM Cadet for the Defence Science Technology Group.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My technical skills are extensive, with proficiency in programming languages such as Java, R, C++, SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am known for my adaptability, effective communication, and ability to work both independently and as part of a team. These qualities have been recognized through several awards, including the Flinders University Chancellor’s Letter of Commendation and the Horizon Professional Development Awards.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond my academic and professional life, I am deeply involved in extracurricular activities. As President of the Flinders University Computer Society (FUCS) and a GitHub Campus Expert, I lead initiatives that foster learning and growth within the tech community. Volunteering as part of the Inspire Mentorship Program and participating in the RobotX Software Team are just a few examples of my commitment to giving back and staying engaged with cutting-edge technology.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I’m not immersed in code or collaborating on projects, I enjoy spending my free time hiking, knitting, and playing games. These hobbies provide a refreshing balance to my busy schedule and allow me to unwind and recharge. My love for continuous learning extends to my technical interests, and I am eager to delve deeper into data analysis, machine learning, and new programming languages like Rust and Julia.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website and taking the time to learn more about me. I am passionate about technology and always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact form on this site. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
