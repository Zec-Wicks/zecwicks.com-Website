        <h1>Welcome to my Personal Website!</h1>
        <p>My name is Zec, I'm a dedicated and passionate third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (Software) (Honours) and a Bachelor of Information Technology (Network and Cybersecurity Systems) at Flinders University. With a strong academic background, and a broad range of practical experience, I'm committed to excelling in the fields of software engineering and cybersecurity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've been recognized for my excellence and dedication, receiving the prestigious Flinders University Chancellorâ€™s Letter of Commendation in both 2023 and 2024. I've also actively engaged in professional development, earning multiple Horizon Professional Development awards, culminating in the Gold Award with a Leadership Specialisation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond academics, I have extensive work experience in various roles, including as a Casual Tutor at Westminster School, a Student and STEM Ambassador at Flinders University, and most recently a STEM Cadet for the Defence Science Technology Group. My technical skills span across multiple programming languages, including Java, R, C++, SQL, Python, and web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outside of my professional life, I have a keen interest in data analysis and machine learning, and I'm an active member of several communities, including serving as the GitHub Campus Expert for Flinders University and Adelaide. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, knitting, or enjoying video games.</p>
