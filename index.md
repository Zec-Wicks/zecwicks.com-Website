My name is Zec, I'm a dedicated and passionate third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (Software) (Honours) and a Bachelor of Information Technology (Network and Cybersecurity Systems) at Flinders University. With a strong academic background, and a broad range of practical experience, I'm committed to excelling in the fields of software engineering and cybersecurity.

Outside of my professional life, I have a keen interest in data analysis and machine learning, and I'm an active member of several communities, including serving as the GitHub Campus Expert for Flinders University and Adelaide. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, knitting, or enjoying video games.
