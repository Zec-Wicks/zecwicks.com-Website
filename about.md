Hello! My name is Zechariah Wicks, and I am a student at Flinders University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Software (Honours) alongside a Bachelor of Information Technology in Network and Cybersecurity Systems. I am dedicated to achieving academic excellence while continuously exploring the vast fields of software engineering and cybersecurity.

From a young age, I have been captivated by technology's transformative power. My educational journey began at Westminster School, where I developed a strong foundation and passion. This early exposure to the possibilites of this field fueled my passion for technology and motivated me to dive deeper into computer science and related disciplines.

In addition to my studies, I have gained diverse professional experience through various roles. At Westminster School, I work as a Casual Tutor, and Boys Boarding Supervisor, honing my communication and leadership skills, allowing me to thrive in dynamic environments. As a Student and STEM Ambassador at Flinders University, I actively engage with peers and promote STEM fields, fostering a collaborative and innovative community. Most recently I have been priviledged enough to achieve the role of a STEM Cadet for the Defence Science Technology Group. Over the past year, I have had numerous opportunities to learn, grow, and excell in this role.

My technical skills are extensive, with proficiency in programming languages such as Java, R, C++, SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am known for my adaptability, effective communication, and ability to work both independently and as part of a team. These qualities have been recognized through several awards, including the Flinders University Chancellor’s Letter of Commendation and the Horizon Professional Development Awards.

When I’m not immersed in code or collaborating on projects, I enjoy spending my free time hiking, knitting, and playing games. These hobbies provide a refreshing balance to my busy schedule and allow me to unwind and recharge. My love for continuous learning extends to my technical interests, and I am eager to delve deeper into data analysis, machine learning, and new programming languages like Rust and Julia.
